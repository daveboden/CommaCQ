/**
 * The user may choose to extend the Manager type to add useful methods
 * (e.g. getActive(id) and mustGetActive(id) which introduce the concept
 * of a bean that can be active or inactive and allows the user only
 * to get active instances).
 * 
 * However, it is not encouraged to extend the manager just in order
 * name the manager and make it 'easier' to autowire. Autowiring will be helped
 * by convention. A manager for an entity called "product" will be, by default,
 * given an identifier of "productManager". By using this name for the field
 * name, the user will find that the correct manager is automatically injected
 * into a declaration: @Resource private Manager<Product> productManager;
 * If the user wishes to name the field differently, or give the manager a different
 * resource (Spring) identifier, then @Resource(name=...) will make the autowiring
 * pick the correct resource.
 * 
 * Responsible for initialising the bean cache on construction so that as soon
 * as the client gets the manager, it's ready.
